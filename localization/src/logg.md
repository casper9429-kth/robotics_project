# odom_init

# 1. When starts init eveything at origo

# 2. Get pose of aruco marker

# 3. Move base_link so aruco_marker is in odom

# 4. Send one TF frame of base_link

# 5. Broadcast init position in map frame of base_link so odometry can take over. Maybe Should be merged with odometry instead!?!?!?
